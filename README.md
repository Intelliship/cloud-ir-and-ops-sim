# cloud-ir-and-ops-sim

This repository models incident response, system hardening, and operational recovery workflows using real-world patterns from logistics and cloud infrastructure environments.

The project draws on experience leading system automation and compliance operations in transportation and enterprise contexts. It simulates how incident response and regulatory requirements were handled across hybrid and cloud platforms, and includes:

- Scenario walkthroughs based on system events and recovery logic  
- Lightweight automation examples using Ansible, Python, and PowerShell  
- Security checklists and operational templates aligned with NIST, STIG, and FedRAMP frameworks  

This repo is intended to demonstrate how incident response and system engineering principles intersect with operational uptime, workflow automation, and infrastructure modernization.
